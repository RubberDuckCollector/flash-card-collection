## Flash cards

*hello world*

**hello world**

***hello world***

My flash cards are stored in this repo.

Find the Quizlet forms of my cards [here!](https://quizlet.com/Eingabeaufforderung/folders)

**These flash cards are stored in text files in the format `term|definition`. Feel free to write your own code that parses them and quizzes you** 

For my own version of this that redoes quizlet write in my own style, check out [quizlet-write](https://github.com/RubberDuckCollector/quizlet-write)!

    <summary>Technical note:</summary>
    I didn't use JSON to store the flash cards because the <code>term|definition</code> is sufficient, and it's so simple it's easily machine-readable by simple program code.
    It's also quicker to write the flash cards in this format, and I could make vim remaps to easily find the | and put extra data in the flash card with just 1 keystroke; <code>(reflexive)</code> and <code>(starts with <letter>)</code>. Writing with remaps and vim is much quicker than on the quizlet webiste at least

### Languages

- my flash card sets are more usable than the ones in the textbook.
    - e.g in spanish, the masculine + feminine forms of each adjective are in my cards in a more explicit format compared to the textbook
    - the male + female versions of nouns like *jefe* and *jefa* are explicit in my flash cards, whereas the Spanish textbooks I've made the cards from don't do this
    - this makes it easier to recall feminine versions of words because they are given equal significance in the flash card set, which is not the case in the textbooks, making my flash cards more usable

#### Dutch

- Flash cards:
    - Cannot find any active GCSE or A level courses on Dutch in the UK. The closest I can find is an old OCR course however I haven't found any textbooks and the course was discontinued just before the switch from A*-U to 9-1.
    - Have fun with a sparratic mix of topics
    - Dutch flash cards have plurals for all nouns because it's a bit confusing
